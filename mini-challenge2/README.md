# npr Mini-Challenge 2

Mini-Challenge 2-C (LE6):
Chatbot

You build a simple chatbot for hotel recommendation (here you can combine with npr and webscraping challenge) or extend the chatbot from the library (auxilio, please take contact with me), with rasa or dialogflow. You can also propose a use case. Important is the way intent are recognized and NER or variables are extracted. Delivery is a report on the use case, interactions and how intents are recognized and variables extracted. Also an error analysis on concrete conversations (confidence of models, explanation of predictions, etc.) should be undertaken. The submission can be done in a group of 2 or 3.
